I have been a very successful web&mobile developer for over 11 years, working for individuals all over the world.

Since I have started iOS and Android app development, I have been spending every spare minute writing code for the iPhone, and learning everything on mobile application development. Additionally to development of new apps, a lot of the work I do is on-going maintenance of existing popular apps.
And I have experience on Web Development for over 7 years. 

I always aim to maintain a long term relationship with my clients. Whether you've lost your original developer, need additional resources, or want a brand new app, I can step in and take over wherever you need. Thanks!
